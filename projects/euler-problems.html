    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>This challenge was my first encounter with Ruby, Ruby is termed to be a very "coder-friendly" language but for me it was not so. <br>The idea behind solving these tough logical problems, was initially trying to solve it using brute-force, writing down what you thought <br>on pen and paper, then writing some pseudo code for the logic and convering that thought into Ruby code. It turned out to be a pretty fun exercise!</p>
