<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>After watching several tutorial videos, I was instructed to create
    a replica of a website, that would help me display the skills I had learnt. It challenged me to use some very detailed styling for the page and some new functions such as Sass and nested styling, I think making this website made me realise that designing was one of my strengths!</p>
